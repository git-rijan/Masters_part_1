# Thesis_part_1
solve and store potenital equation and calculate path trajectories
change l for length, b for breadth , p for outlet pressure ,
vel_left and vel_right for inlet and outlet veloctiy in main.py


main.py returns pickle file with f_x and f_y value at each point of the domain(force experienced by body)

then run test.py accordingly to calculate the next few point the body takes, returns pickle file with path coordinates.
